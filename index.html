            The Alberti Program: Architecture for Young People devoted three summers to the core themes of the Divided City Initiative. Fourth through eleventh grade students from schools in the St. Louis Public School District do 2-D and 3-D hands-on problem solving, use the libraries and computer labs on campus, and are introduced to the field of architecture through lectures, discussions, and reviews about design projects.</p>

          <p>Jasmine Brown, a biology major, and Camille "Mimi" Borders, a history major, are Washington University's newest Rhodes Scholars. The Ervin Scholars and sorority sisters leaned on each other during the intense application process for Rhodes and now are best friends. Here, the two show off their British slang, scholarly research and reflect on what it means to be role models.</p>

          <p>Professor Rebecca Messbarger, a cultural historian of early modern medicine and director of medical humanities, discusses the importance of the medical humanities as well as her own research into the life and work of Anna Morandi Manzolini (1714-1774). The history of medicine is “embedded in the DNA of contemporary medical science and medical practice,” she says. “In order to know who we are and what we’re doing, we absolutely have to know where we came from.”</p>
