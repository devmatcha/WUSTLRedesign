# WUSTL Redesign

In my Web Development class, I was assigned to redesign a WUSTL department site that I could improve upon. I chose the website for the School of Arts and Sciences because while the website looks visually appealing, it lacks a direction flow and is therefore difficult to navigate. I decided to maintain some visual properties that I liked about the ArtSci website while giving it a more readible flow of content.
